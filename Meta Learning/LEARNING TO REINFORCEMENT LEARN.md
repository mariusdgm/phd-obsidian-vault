RL methods that adapt quickly to new tasks.

Bandit tasks and MDPs

Address the challenge of developing deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks.

The approach involves training a system using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways and is configured to exploit structure in the training domain.
