Shared autonomy is a situation in which agents adapt to users based on feedbacks to jointly accomplish tasks. In the case of semiautonomous agents such as mobile robots operational load can be reduced by adaptively automating their behavior. Machine learning is one of the method for adapting teleoperated agents to users as control tendency depends on users and environments. It is difficult to regard user inputs as supervisions because user controls are not always available during descisionmaking processes for agents that continually make decisions (such as navigation robots).
