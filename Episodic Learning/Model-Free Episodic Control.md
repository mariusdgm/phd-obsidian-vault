"The two different embeddings (random projections and VAE) did not have a notable effect on the performance of the episodic control policies. Both representations proved more data efficient than the parametric policies. The only exception is Frostbite where the VAE features perform noticeably worse. This may be due to the inability of a random policy to reach very far in the game, which results in a very poor training-set for the VAE."

Would it make sense to also allow the online training of the VAE?
