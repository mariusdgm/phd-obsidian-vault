[[2010.01430] Episodic Memory for Learning Subjective-Timescale Models (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01430)

## Conclusion

We proposed STM, a novel approach to learning a transition dynamics model with the use of sequences of episodic memories, which define an agentâ€™s more useful, subjective timescale. As shown, the emergent properties of STM can be useful to different model-based agents that rely on the transition dynamics model in either training or inference. We demonstrated its effectiveness within two types of agents and by using several complex 3D foraging tasks within DMLab and AAI. Nevertheless, a limitation of the current version of STM is its action summarisation heuristic. We pose that integrating general techniques for summarising sequences of actions will allow for more advanced planning and application to environments with more demanding control requirements
