[Graph Backup: Data Efficient Backup Exploiting Markovian Data | OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=0UQqmPGuL4n)

Review on MiniGrid and Minatar (We set the overall number of interactions to be 100â€™000, which is inspired by the Atari100K benchmark)

shows graph backup can greatly improve data efficiency compared to one-step and multi-step backup

## Conclusion
In this work, we motivate the introduction of a novel bootstrapped value estimation operator, graph backup. This backup method utilises the graph-structured nature of MDP transition data to enable counterfactual credit assignment and variance reduction. We propose two implementations of the graph backup and demonstrate graph backup surpasses multi-step and one-step backup in MiniGrid and Minatar tasks. For future work, we hope to expand graph backup to higher-dimensional and continuous state-space environments. For higher-dimensional environments, the data graph might be much sparser, so we potentially need either a preprocessed or a learned discrete representation of the state.
