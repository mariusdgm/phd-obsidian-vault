[[2203.03078v1] Fast and Data Efficient Reinforcement Learning from Pixels via Non-Parametric Value Approximation (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.03078v1)

[[Atari 100k]]

## Conclusion 

We have introduced a locally generalising approach to RL that is both sample and computationally efficient, achieving state of the art performance in the low sample regime on ATARI while requiring two orders of magnitude less walltime.
