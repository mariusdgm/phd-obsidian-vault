Episodic control provides a highly sample-efficient method for reinforcement learning while enforcing high memory and computational requirements. 

This work proposes a simple heuristic for reducing these requirements, and an application to Model-Free Episodic Control (MFEC) is presented. 

Experiments on Atari games show that this heuristic successfully reduces MFEC computational demands while producing no significant loss of performance when conservative choices of hyperparameters are used. Consequently, episodic control becomes a more feasible option when dealing with reinforcement learning tasks.

Our methods could be applied to NEC as well, but we focus on MFEC  
in this work.
