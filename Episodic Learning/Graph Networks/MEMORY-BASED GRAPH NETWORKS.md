Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a class of deep models that operate on data  
with arbitrary topology represented as graphs. We introduce an efficient mem-  
ory layer for GNNs that can jointly learn node representations and coarsen the  
graph. We also introduce two new networks based on this layer: memory-based  
GNN (MemGNN) and graph memory network (GMN) that can learn hierarchical  
graph representations. The experimental results show that the proposed models  
achieve state-of-the-art results in eight out of nine graph classification and regres-  
sion benchmarks. We also show that the learned representations could correspond  
to chemical features in the molecule data. Code and reference implementations  
are released at: https://github.com/amirkhas/GraphMemoryNet
